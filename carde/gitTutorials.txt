git branch: See current branch
git switch: Switch to branch
git pull: Pull from main branch on gitLab (Only works on main branch)
git pull origin main: Pulls from local main branch to personal branch (Use on your own branch)
git push: Pushes changes to main branch on gitLab (Only do this on your own branch)

The sequence of work goes as follows:
    git switch main - to go to the local main branch
    git pull - from master main to local main branch
    git switch [your personal working branch here] - to go to the personal local branch
    git pull origin main - pulls from local main branch to your own working branch

    *** code and do changes here in this step***

    after finishing all of the changes, use source control tab and post the commit there
    git push - pushes the changes from your working branch

NOTE:

not the most detailed especially at the end and may change as we continue down.
